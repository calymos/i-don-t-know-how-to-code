//Global Variables

Grade values, int(s) A == 4; B == 3; C == 2; D == 1; F == 0; |

Output - float GPA;

X == null; (or whatever C# needs for you to direct the program to a different loop, as long as you check it first, it should be fine as basically anything)

//Local Variables

int Count; (should start at 1, and reset everytime the program is run from the beginning) 
int GradeSum;
int input; 

//each passthrough below here

First start-
console output  ( "This program will output your GPA average. Please inputer your current crades as "A B C D F", and when you are done, please enter "X". 
                    The system will not recognize other characters.") then goto step one

Additional start ("Please enter more grade letters or enter "X" to finish.") then to step one

step one-

Take user input.

step two-

Check if user input is "X"

step two A

If user input is "X", then { GPA == GradeSum/Count; output "Your GPA is currently {GPA}." } then reset program state to default.

step two B

Check if user input is "A" or "B" or "C" or "D" or "F"

If user input is one of the above, set input to that var. then set GradeSum += GradeSum + input; then increment count++; then return to additional start

ayy hope this helps and if not, thank you for getting me thinking like this again, it's been a really long time
